# e-commerce-follow-along
### *Project Overview: E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack)*
This project will guide you through building a full-stack e-commerce web application using the *MERN stack* (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). You will learn how to implement key functionalities such as *user authentication, **product management, and **order handling* while gaining hands-on experience with REST APIs, database schema design, and frontend development with React.

---

### *Key Features:*
- *User Authentication:* Secure login and registration with JWT.
- *Product Management:* CRUD operations for products, with features like filtering and sorting.
- *Order Handling:* Users can place and view orders.
- *REST API:* Build scalable API endpoints for managing users, products, and orders.
- *Frontend:* Responsive UI built with React for a smooth user experience.

---

### *Core Concepts:*
- *MERN Stack*: Using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for full-stack development.
- *REST APIs*: Design and develop API endpoints for user and product management.
- *Authentication*: Implement secure login and session management.
- *Database Schema*: Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders.

---

### *Next Steps:* 
1. Set up the *development environment* and install dependencies.
2. Implement a *basic server* using Node.js and Express.
3. Start building the *React frontend* and connect it to the backend.
4. Design *MongoDB schemas* for structured data storage.

This project will help you master the full-stack development process, from database to frontend, with a focus on scalability and user interaction.

 ### Milestone 2 ###
1. Created a structured folder hierarchy for the project.
2. Set up a React app for the frontend.
3. Set up a Node.js server for the backend.
4. Configured Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.
5. Added optional extensions for improving development efficiency.
6. Built a functional and styled Login Page for the frontend.

### Milestone 3 ###

1. Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively.
2. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests.
3. Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage data.
4. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation.

### Milestone 4 ###

This milestone focuses on implementing user data handling and file upload functionality. 

Key achievements include:  
1. User Model: Defined a blueprint for storing user data in the database, ensuring a consistent structure for user-related information.  
2. User Controller: Developed logic to manage user operations such as adding new users and retrieving user information.  
3. File Upload Setup: Integrated and configured Multer to enable file uploads (e.g., user profile images) and store them efficiently in the application.  

By completing this milestone, the application now supports user management and file uploads, enhancing its core functionality.

## MILESTONE 5 :-
1. Created a Sign-Up Page in React.
2. Implemented form validation for:
    Name (required)
    Email (valid format required)
    Password (minimum 2 characters)
    Password Confirmation (must match password)

4. Used React Router for navigation.

## Milestone 6 :-
## Milestone 6: User Registration and Authentication
1. User Creation Endpoint (/create-user):
 Implemented an endpoint to create a new user.
 Validated the email to ensure the user doesn’t already exist.
 Successfully handled file uploads (e.g., avatar) using multer.

 2. Password Hashing:
 Used bcryptjs to hash passwords before saving them to the database, ensuring secure password storage.

4. Error Handling:
Incorporated centralized error handling using a custom ErrorHandler class.
Applied catchAsyncErrors middleware to manage asynchronous errors in the routes.

5. User Data Storage:
Stored user details (e.g., name, email, password, avatar) in MongoDB with encrypted password.

6. Email Notification (Optional):
Integrated an email notification system to send a welcome email to the user after successful registration (using sendMail).

7. JWT Token Generation:
Added a method to generate JWT tokens upon user login (for future use in authentication routes).


### Milestone 7: Create Login Endpoint
Task Completed ✅
Implemented a login API endpoint.
Accepted user credentials (email/username and password).
Retrieved the corresponding user from the database.
Validated the password using bcrypt.
Compared the entered password with the stored hashed password for authentication.
Generated a JWT token upon successful login for authentication.
Implemented error handling for invalid credentials and server errors.


## Milestone -8 Progress:
Three files were made:
1) Product.jsx in Components/auth to store info. about product details.
2) user.js
3) data/js
We have createrd a reusable card component with props for product details.

## Milestone 9: Create Product Component

Overview

In this milestone, we have implemented the Create Product component for the Follow-Along Ecommerce project. This component allows users to create new products by entering details such as name, description, category, tags, price, stock, email, and uploading images.

Features Implemented

Form Inputs: Users can input product details including name, description, category, tags, price, stock, and email.

Image Upload & Preview: Users can upload multiple images, which will be displayed as previews before submission.

Category Selection: A dropdown to choose a product category.

Validation & Submission: Required fields are enforced, and product data is logged on submission.

Memory Optimization: Object URLs for image previews are revoked to prevent memory leaks.

Technologies Used

React: Functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect).

Tailwind CSS: For styling.

React Icons: AiOutlinePlusCircle for the image upload button.

## ###Milestone 10: Product Management Enhancements


Milestone 10 focuses on refining the product creation and management process. This includes improving the form submission flow, handling errors effectively, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

Key Features Implemented

Form Submission & Error Handling

Implemented a structured form to capture product details including:

Name

Description

Price

Category

Tags

Stock

Email

Multiple Images

Integrated multiple image selection for better product representation.

Enhanced error handling using try-catch methods to catch and display errors during product creation.

Debugging tools added to log form data before submission for easier troubleshooting.

API Integration

Built a POST endpoint to receive and validate product data.

Used FormData to handle file uploads efficiently.

Sent form data to the backend API, ensuring proper request formatting (multipart/form-data).

Provided real-time feedback to users on successful product creation or errors encountered.

Why Validation & Error Handling?

Ensures only valid data is stored in the database.

Helps users identify and correct input mistakes quickly.

Prevents incomplete or invalid submissions, reducing inconsistencies in the system.

Technologies Used

React.js for frontend UI

Express.js for backend API handling

MongoDB & Mongoose for database storage

Axios for HTTP requests

Postman for API testing

Next Steps & Enhancements

Implement user authentication to restrict product uploads to authorized users.

Develop an admin panel to manage and moderate product listings.

Introduce real-time image preview and editing capabilities.

Optimize database indexing for faster search and retrieval.
